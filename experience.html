        <h2>WHAT I WAS DOING</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Split and raised in Split, Croatia. And the following is cliché but true. Ever so true. I was i waiter, washed cars, along with all sorts of labor intensive  jobs, you name it in the restaurant business and I’ve done it. I was in all kind of sports and played all kind of video games. All this has really given me a new & unique perspective. Whether in personal matters, or in my job, the same things hold true. What is the problem? And how do I solve that problem?</p>

          <h2>WHAT I’M DOING</h2>
          <p>I'm lucky enough that I was able to learn about Treehouse. It was a great oportunity for me to learn coding and change my life. So now when I found out I can have a diploma I jumped on that oportunity right away. Constantly learning new things is my main moto in life. </p>

          <h2>FUTURE</h2>
          <p>Future??? What can I say about the future? From my perspective is looking bright. Didn't know anything about developing web pages three months ago, but now I am starting to understand it way better and it's getting more rewarding and fun each day. Three months from now, we will see.</p>
